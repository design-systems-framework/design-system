# Design Systems Framework: Raison d’être
## The Problem
Design systems, help us efficiently apply and distribute our design opinions throughout our products. This efficiency helps us create user experiences that are more consistent across products, which lends to opportunities  for cohesive interoperability.  (Bitbucket and Jira for example or MacOS and iOS)

Often times a substantial amount of effort in setting up design-systems is spent implementing and  (often times) repeating functionality around:

	- Accessibility standards
	- Interaction and state management
	- Platform independent best practices
	- Compositional API

These are often times the same or very similar across most design-systems.

## Design Systems as a composition
The conventional way of looking at a design-system is a library of Components, associated documentation and patterns. However we can also think of them as a composition of design / thematic options over encapsulated functionality.

```
ds = f(t)
```

Our hypothesis is that by providing building blocks that represent  `f` ,  we empower design-system authors to focus more of their energy on the  bespoke aspects of their design-system, and not on the boiler-plate.
