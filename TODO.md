## TODO

### Infra:

- [ ] Setup CI
- [ ] Setup Netlify and integrate with CI
- [ ] Setup build step for non website workspaces.
- [ ] Integrate with change-sets
- [ ] Setup initial dev workflow with Next.js
- [ ] Setup dev loop external of Next.js site\*

- Dev loop (Hot reloading, link-monorepos(-badly?))
  - changesets, bot
- Build + deploy/publish (site(s) + packages)
  - Branch preview
  - CI (unit/cypress/????(Visual regression, code quality(ESLint/code climate like things), a11y))
  - Release Automation (Also would be good for Keystone)
- Copy Keystone 5 website, maybe make a Gatsby theme

#### Order of things:

1. DSF + Elemental dev loop and everything working as well as Keystone is
2. Gold DS or Enlitic is productive
3. Release automation

### Unstyled Components:

- [ ] Button
- [ ] Textfield
- [ ] ???

### Elemental Components:

- [ ] Button
- [ ] Textfield

\* = probably not high priority till we decide to make this thing public)
