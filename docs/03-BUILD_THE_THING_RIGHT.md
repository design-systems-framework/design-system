## Building the thing right:
We now have an understanding of what our design system aims to solve, and also roughly its conceptual and contextual boundaries.

As we start building the different aspects of our design-system we need to be critical interrogate them with the help of the following questions:

1. Is it fit for purpose?
2. What's the use-case for this feature, how will it help us service the end-user?
3. How do we make divergence explicit?
-  [ ] What are the extensibility points?
-  [ ] What happens if someone wants to opt-out at a certain point?
-  [ ] What patterns of compose-ability do we have at our disposal, and which is the right one?
