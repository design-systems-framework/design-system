## DS-F
In reference to the thoughts we've underlined in [BUILD_THE_RIGHT_THING](https://github.com/design-systems-framework/design-system/tree/master/docs/BUILD_THE_RIGHT_THING.md).
It'll be important to continuously refine how we think about DSF, and how we envision it to enable the creation, maintenance and use of design-systems. The following will help us do this:

1. How much of this is repeatable?
2. Are your previous assumptions still good?
3. How do we enable the creation of design-systems that are consistently delivering value?

We should also write down our assumptions and continue to critically review them as we iterate on this work.
